  <h1>Updates</h1>
  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap">
11/14/2013:
  - Re-organized structure.
  - Added "Key Algorithms and Semantics" section.
  - Added "Cross-cutting Concerns and Potential Implementation Challenges"
11/13/2013:
  - Fixed a bunch of editorial issues discovered by Joshua Bell.
  - Rebase spec changes against Rev21 ES6 Draft
10/29/2013:
  - notifier.performChange now emits a change record if the return value of the changeFn is an object (feedback from Sept TC-39)
  - "intrinsic" change record types renamed for consistency. "new" -> "add", "updated" -> "update", "deleted" -> "delete", "reconfigured" -> "reconfigure", "prototype" -> "setPrototype" (feedback from Sept TC-39)
  - "preventExtensions" changeRecord type is now emitted when the first time an object's `[[Extensible]]` internal property is set to false.
9/12/2013:
  - Object.observe accept arg can be zero-length (now specifies that accept.length must be > 0).
7/20/2013:
  - Notifier.performChange, Array.observe & some refactoring of algorithms.
1/30/2013:
  - Suppress oldValue when the changeRecord is of type 'reconfigured' and the oldValue and present value are the same. Note that CreateChangeRecord now takes both oldDesc and newDesc as arguments.
12/21/2012:
  - Object.deliverChangeRecords now calls `[[DeliverChangeRecords]]` repeatedly until there no pending records to deliver.
11/19/2012:
  - Object.observer/unobserve now return the object (for consistency with Object.freeze, etc...).
11/13/2012:
  - In Object.unobserve, passing a non-function as the callback now throws (for symmetry with Object.observe).

10/28/2012:
  - In CreateChangeRecord, renamed fourth argument to "oldDesc" (from "desc") for clarity.
  - In CreateChangeRecord, shallow freeze created changeRecord (consistent with Notifier.prototype.notify).

10/23/2012:
  - In notify, moved the check for type not being a string above the check for empty observers so the error will throw regardless of if there are observers.
  - Change the spec language of notify to make it clear to return before creating the changeRecord if there are no observers.

9/11/2012:
  - Added a section that we need to schedule a `{type: "prototype", object: ..., oldValue: ...}` change record when the `[[Prototype]]` internal property is changed.

7/18/2012:
  - Only fire **`"updated"`** changes when value changes (using SameValue) and no other configuration change happens.

7/17/2012: Based on feedback from Mark Miller, Tom van Cutsem and Andreas Rossberg:
  - _anyWorkDone_ should be or'ed with the previous value.
  - Refactored into `[[GetNotifier]]` to ensure it is always initialized.
  - **`"descriptor"`** is now always **`"reconfigured"`**
  - Enforce that _changeRecord_ is frozen in `[[NotifierPrototype]]`.notify.
  - Never pass a descriptor in the change record. Only include oldValue if it was a data property before the change.
  - Remove redundant IsCallable check in unobserve.
  - Ensure that _O_ is an object in Object.getNotifier.
  

7/4/2012: Per security feedback from Mark Miller
  - Object.getNotifier() of frozen object, returns null.
  - Object `[[Notifier]]` is spec'd to be lazily created to avoid infinite regress.
  - All changeRecords are shallowly frozen, and "reconfigured" changeRecords have their oldValue (property descriptor) frozen.
  - Validate **`"object"`** field of _changeRecord_ for _notifyFunction_ so as to ensure that notifier of an object can only broadcast changes of its `[[Target]]`.
  - Validate **`"type"`** and **`"name"`** fields of _changeRecord_ for _notifyFunction_ and perform a shallow freeze to prevent unintentional delivery of shared mutable state.
  - Object.retrieveChangeRecords -> Object.deliverChangeRecords (invoke the function rather than return records).
  - Object callbacks invokations silently ignore all thrown exceptions and return values.
  - Frozen callback function objects cannot be registered as change observers (Object.observe) throws TypeError.

7/2/2012:
  - Remove changeRecord validation. Since there is no way to validate "oldValue", arbitrary data can always be passed.
  - Added Object.getNotifier(obj).notify(changeRecord) separation, so as to allow freezing of an object to prevent side-channel, but retaining the ability to notify if getNotifier() was called prior to freezing.

5/17/2012:
  - Call the callbacks with a ChangeRecord object describing the change.
  - Add sanity checks in `[[ToChangeRecord]]` which is used in `Object.notifyObservers`.
  - Add `Object.retrieveChangeRecords` which allows synchronous access to the pending changes.

3/16/2012:  Two requests from feedback from Rafael Weinstein and Erik Arvidsson:
  - Pass old property values as well as new to `[[FireChangeListeners]]`
  - Schedule change events to be delivered asynchronously "at the end of the turn"
